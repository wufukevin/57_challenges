Create a program that calculates the area of a room. Prompt
the user for the length and width of the room in feet. Then
display the area in both square feet and square meters.

Example Output

What is the length of the room in feet? 15

What is the width of the room in feet? 20

You entered dimensions of 15 feet by 20 feet.

The area is

300 square feet

27.871 square meters

The formula for this conversion is
m^2 = f^2 × 0.09290304

Constraints

- Keep the calculations separate from the output.
- Use a constant to hold the conversion factor.
- Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Don’t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
- Create a new version of the program that allows you to choose feet or meters for your inputs.
