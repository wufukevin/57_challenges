Challenges

- Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Don’t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
- Alter the output so it handles pluralization properly, for example:
`Each person gets 2 pieces of pizza.
or
Each person gets 1 piece of pizza.`
Handle the output for leftover pieces appropriately as well.˜
- Create a variant of the program that prompts for the number of people and the number of pieces each person wants, and calculate how many full pizzas you need to purchase.
