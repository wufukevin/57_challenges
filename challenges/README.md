Create a program that compares two strings and determines
if the two strings are anagrams. The program should prompt
for both input strings and display the output as shown in
the example that follows.

Example Output
Enter two strings and I'll tell you if they are anagrams:
Enter the first string: note
Enter the second string: tone
"note" and "tone" are anagrams.

Constraints
• Implement the program using a function called isAnagram, which takes in two words as its arguments and returns true or false. 
Invoke this function from your main program.
• Check that both words are the same length.
• Complete this program without using built-in language features. Use selection or repetition logic instead and develop your own algorithm.
