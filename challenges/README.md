Write a program that asks for three numbers. Check first to
see that all numbers are different. If they’re not different,
then exit the program. Otherwise, display the largest number
of the three.

Example Output
Enter the first number: 1
Enter the second number: 51
Enter the third number: 2
The largest number is 51.

Constraint
• Write the algorithm manually. Don’t use a built-in function for finding the largest number in a list.
• Modify the program so that all entered values are tracked and the user is prevented from entering a number that’s already been entered.
• Modify the program so that it asks for an unlimited number of numbers.
